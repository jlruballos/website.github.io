I am a graduate student at Oregon State University in the School of Mechanical, Industrial, and Manufacturing Engineering. As a member of and the robotics research lab on Social Haptics, Assistive Robotics, and Embodiment (SHARE Lab), I study socially assistive robotics with a special focus on the elderly and people who struggle with mobility.
