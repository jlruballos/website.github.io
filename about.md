title: About Me
---

I am a graduate student in Robotics at Oregon State University. I hope to utilize robotics in elderly care and support.

I am experienced in automation, control systems and SCADA engineering in high-reliability and safety-oriented industries (Oil & Gas, Water Treatment, and Distribution). In the past, I have supported high-availability industrial control systems across Southern California in every capacity. Proficient in Spanish.
