I programmed, debugged, and tested a 3-degree-of-freedom "pick-and-place" robot manipulator. 
Leveraging a PSoC miscrocontroller and servomotors, the robot used precise grid-based drawing to move.
Machine learning and computer vision techniques enabled detection of shapes and colors via an integrated camera.
